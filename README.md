# 🚗 CO₂ Emission Predictions

This project builds a machine learning model using Python to predict **CO₂ emissions** of vehicles based on engine and fuel characteristics. The model is developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment and includes end-to-end steps from data cleaning to model evaluation.

## 🔍 ML Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression
- Data preprocessing (feature scaling, encoding)
- Model evaluation (MAE, R², residuals)

---

## 📈 Results

The trained regression model effectively predicts CO₂ emissions. Model performance is assessed using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
